            My internship at UFCU taught me so much about so many things, it's impossible to know where to begin. 
            It provided me not only an opportunity to use my coding skills and business skills, 
            but it has allowed me to get a deeper look into the realm of financial technology.  
            This internship truly cemented my interest in financial technology while also showing me the value of a company’s people and culture.

        <h3>Consumer Lending Team (Omni)</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            For the first six weeks I worked on the Omni team, mainly on the front end of their consumer lending application.
             As anyone who has ever been a beginner before can attest, coding in a language that you are unfamiliar with is highly intimidating, and those first few weeks were no different. 
             The app used React framework with Typescript with a C# backend.
             By the end of it I was able to complete complicated tasks on my own and felt like I was really contributing to the team as a whole - something I truly learned to appreciate. 
             It was extremely satisfying work that revealed a lot of the strengths and weaknesses of my own development skills, while exposing me to working in an agile developement environment. 
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            After this, I joined the Member Systems team where I worked with Boni Rosales on his micro-projects and various tasks.  
            Learning from Bo was an incredible experience as I was able to work with the Core system and get a developers perspective on the business. 
            This also allowed me to see which “tools” and languages are unique to UFCU, and which are used outside of the Credit Union by software companies everywhere.
            I spent the majority of my time writting queries for the Market Communications team, so that they could target specific members of the credit union.  
            It was valuable work that helped refine my SQL skills.

        <h3>The Experience</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            The experience as a whole is a reflection of the incredible mission and values that UFCU maintains. 
            From hiring and onboarding, to working on these teams, nobody was ever too busy to lend a helping hand or explain a concept to me,
            even though they had their own busy schedules. 
            No task, no matter how small felt menial: every time I touched the code I felt as if I were providing a service that would be valued by someone.
        </p>

        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            The pandemic that seems to have consumed everything in our lives has proved incapable of taking this feeling away from me. 
            Going forward it is something I will continue to strive for, in my work, be it academic or otherwise. 
            Prior to this internship, I would have never considered searching for a position based on the company’s culture or by the value of the work I would be doing. 
            UFCU has shown me that these two aspects of the job search are incredibly important, and this advice is something I would want to pass on to my peers searching for similar opportunities.
