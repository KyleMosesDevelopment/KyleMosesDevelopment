            I have held two on-campus roles during my time as an undergrad at St. Edwards University. 
            The first being a Freshman Peer Mentor/Teaching Assistant and the second being an 
            Office of Information Technology Advisor.  
        </p>
        <h3>Freshman Peer Mentor</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            In the fall semester of 2019, I was invited to take on the role of a freshman peer mentor. 
            This role required me to assist the professor for one of the freshman courses and also lead 
            the students in this course to events held at St.Edwards. I built several close bonds with 
            some of the freshmen in the class and I believe I was selected for this role in part for my ability 
            to make connections with people from all backgrounds. The hardest part of this job was ensuring that 
            the students I became friends with actually succeeded and thrived in the course. 
            Grading and tutoring was difficult but gratifying work. Although invited to continue to do this role again 
            in the next semester, I chose to pursue other clubs and involvement at the school that pertained more 
            to my interest in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <h3>Office of Information Technology Advisor</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            Right before the start of COVID-19, I was offered a spot in the Office of Information Technology Student Advisors. 
            Typically this role requires one to spend some time at the office desk on campus. 
            Due to the campus shut down, however, the school had its advisors test 
            upcoming software updates to sign-in portals for school related websites. 
            I had the opportunity to give input on design, efficiency, and rollout date while using my knowledge 
            in Computer Science to add value to what I suggested.
        </p>

        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            These roles have been an amazing way to get involved on my campus and also give back to the schoolâ€™s community. 
            Once I realized that the social work of mentoring younger people was not for me, 
            I looked for other ways I could benefit the St. Edwards community based on my expertise and interests. 
            I have enjoyed my Office of IT role and I hope to do more with them in the future as I return to campus.
