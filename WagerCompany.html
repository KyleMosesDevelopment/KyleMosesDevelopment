        <p class="post_paragraph">
            I worked part-time for Wager and Company for six months. 
            This was a great learning experience which gave me an opportunity 
            to develop both my communication and organizational skills.
        </p>
        <h3>Tax Accounting</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            The majority of my job was electronically scanning and organizing client tax records 
            such as Bank Reconciliation Statements, W-9, and Income Statements. 
            After scanning them I would put these files in the correct client folder and give them a proper name/date. 
            I was efficient at this, however, this job did not provide me with much satisfaction or fulfillment 
            due to the lack of variety in tasks.
        </p>
        <h3>Answering Phones</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            Being responsible for answering the phones when someone calls the office is by no means the hardest job in the office. 
            That being said, the clients of Wager and Company were 50% Hispanic people, some of whom only spoke Spanish. 
            This provided a unique challenge for me as my Spanish-speaking abilities were not good enough to effectively 
            respond to all callers. It was a different type of uncomfortable, 
            but trying to do anything that you are bad at can be uncomfortable. 
        </p>

                <img src="images/Form.jpg" class="prev_img small_pic">
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <p class="post_paragraph">
            I think that the biggest take-away from this experience as a whole is that working in a 
            fast-paced environment requires perseverance and determination. 
            Although I was not happy with the tasks I was given, my perseverance to do a good job 
            led to my inevitable growth in the skills required. It taught me that it is OK 
            not to be good at something immediately, but to ensure you are passionate and determined in striving to get better.
